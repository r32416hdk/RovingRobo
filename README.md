The RovingRobo, a group of two members, Eithar and Retal. Although they are very different people, they were able to work together and reach the same goal. Growing up, Eithar Abdulmohsin always wondered about the way things worked. She would look at inventions and would question how it functioned. As the years went by she started to think about her future, and pondered about what she was interested in. At the age of 9, she discovered that technology was something she was fascinated in. While she was born in Saudi Arabia, she moved to the United States of America at the age of 1, and lived there for 11 years, where she learned the English language and took it as her mother tongue. When she came back to Saudi Arabia she joined Shouroq Almamlakkah international school, where she joined the KGL(Kangaroo) and won first place in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The year after that she decided to try something new and join the WRO, because it would teach her new skills. Joining the competition taught her a lot of things, and she made many great memories. One thing she wishes people knew about herself is that she was inspired by her father and the famous Denton Cooley to become a cardiac surgeon. She dreams to become a successful cardiac surgeon, which is something that involves her two passions, the human anatomy, and technology. Her partner in the WRO Retal Al Sharif, a 10th grade student who is also studying in Shorouq Almamlakah international school in taif city, is a technophile with a passion for technology. She aspires to be an IT professional and has already made her mark winning second place in a 3D printer competition. Additionally, she showcased her talents at the Samis robotics Expo in 2023, underscoring her dedication to staying at the IT industry.

Their robot was built and programmed by Spike Prime. Because Spike Prime has a user-friendly interface and powerful computational capabilities, they chose to employ it. Both and Spike Prime are well-liked robotics platforms for general use, each with a unique set of capabilities and benefits.And Spike Prime took a more modern approach to fusing robots with teaching.It seamlessly combines hardware, programming, and practical training.They were easily able to iterate their robot designs thanks to the consistent construction method.
Building the robot they tested many different parts to see which would fit them best. All the parts that they decided to use were chosen with reason and precision. For the brain of the robot they decided to use the Large hub as their source of energy. One thing that made them choose the Large Hub was its three-axis gyroscope that’s built in it. Using the gyroscope was very useful for them as it measures the rotation of degrees and tracks it, which is easily applicable to the program to make the car move straight and to control its exact moves and turns. The hub and the motors are connected using a Technic frame and connector peg with friction. In the front of the car they have an ultrasonic sensor, otherwise known as the distance sensor, to detect surfaces in front of it.Whenever the car notices a surface in front of it, it goes back and turns. The sensor sends ultrasound waves and senses the object based off how the waves bounce back, and from the way that it bounced back it concludes how far the surface is. This is very useful in the competition for how it can avoid the wall and objects. Around the distance sensor there are LED lights that can be useful in the dark. The most important feature is how it can sense from 50mm to 2000mm. In addition to the gyroscope and ultrasonic sensors, Spike Prime also has force, color, and other types of sensors. This variety of sensors enabled them to experiment with more complicated robot behaviors and investigate a wider range of applications..

They decided to enable the vehicle’s back propulsion. They included the medium motor because it helped the vehicle provide accuracy, control, and speed. In the front of the car they used the large motor because it specializes in strength and has more power, which is especially useful for the turning of the car. The problem with spike prime is that every wheel needs a motor, so they used 3 biscuit magentas, and 2 t-beams to connect the wheeels to the motor. Doing it that way allows the motor to easily turn the car in an efficient way. They also use wheel E56 because a carbon fiber wheelset significantly improves performance by striking an excellent mix between weight, strength, and aerodynamics. And to link the wheel to the engine, they used a cross axle 9m, the perfect size for the proportions they were looking for. Using the yaw angles, they made the car go in a straight direction. They decided to place two color sensors on the sides and one facing the front, so that the car could see the red and green colors while it moved in the middle.Them being on the sides of the robot will make the car move backwards and turn depending on the color. The reason for it moving back is so the car can have a wider range to turn. The sensor can detect color, reflectivity, or ambient light. The sensor can also be used as a light output as it has LED lights surrounding the sensor.

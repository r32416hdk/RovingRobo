The RovingRobo, a group of two members, Eithar and Retal. Although they are very different people, they were able to work together and reach the same goal. Growing up, Eithar Abdulmohsin always wondered about the way things worked. She would look at inventions and would question how it functioned. As the years went by she started to think about her future, and pondered about what she was interested in. At the age of 9, she discovered that technology was something she was fascinated in. While she was born in Saudi Arabia, she moved to the United States of America at the age of 1, and lived there for 11 years, where she learned the English language and took it as her mother tongue. When she came back to Saudi Arabia she joined Shouroq Almamlakkah international school, where she joined the KGL(Kangaroo) and won first place in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The year after that she decided to try something new and join the WRO, because it would teach her new skills. Joining the competition taught her a lot of things, and she made many great memories. One thing she wishes people knew about herself is that she was inspired by her father and the famous Denton Cooley to become a cardiac surgeon. She dreams to become a successful cardiac surgeon, which is something that involves her two passions, the human anatomy, and technology. Her partner in the WRO Retal Al Sharif, a 10th grade student who is also studying in Shorouq Almamlakah international school in taif city, is a technophile with a passion for technology. She aspires to be an IT professional and has already made her mark winning second place in a 3D printer competition. Additionally, she showcased her talents at the Samis robotics Expo in 2023, underscoring her dedication to staying at the IT industry.
